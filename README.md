Build for those who require assistance in the counting of blue-green algae, ACE is a tool that graphically generates algae colonies with known counts. Users may test their ability to count these colonies with this program and be provided statistics regarding how they've done.

For more info, see the User's Manual located in the Docs folder.

This project was originally commissioned for the Institute for Watershed Studies of Western Washington University.
